# Research Interests

I have the good fortune of being a research scientist at IBM research where I am currently considering various algorithms and applications of **(mostly stochastic) bilevel optimization in AI and machine learning**. You can find more about this [here](./research/bilevel.md). I have also studied the bilevel problem(s) appearing in **Automated Machine Learning and AI (AutoML and AutoAI)**, developing various new (continuous and discrete) derivative-free algorithms and also understanding various theoretical aspects of the AutoML/AutoAI problem (more details [here](./research/autoai.md)). I have also been lucky to be involved with the [**Lale**](https://github.com/IBM/lale) project on "Gradual AutoML", which allows one to succinctly craft sophisticated ML pipelines, and automate the search of these pipelines.




## Publications

Here is a (loose) categorization of my publications in the different areas:
- [Bilevel Optimization](./research/bilevel.md)
- [Automated Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence / Data Science](./research/autoai.md)
- [Neuro-Inspired Learning](./research/neuro.md)
- [Density Estimation](./research/dest.md)
- [Computation Geometry / All-Pairs Problem](./research/cgallpairs.md)
- [Similarity Search](./research/simsearch.md)

You can find a chronologically sorted list of my publications on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JaXmmnkAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate).


**Experience.**

- Programming languages: Python, C/C++
- Frameworks/libraries: Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, [Lale](https://github.com/IBM/lale), OpenMP, MPI
